        If you have genuinely worked hard, then it will definitely pay off.
        Being a student, if you have worked hard for your exams and given your
        best effort. Then you will score higher marks. History has proved that
        one who works hard will definitely be successful. There might be hurdles
        and failures in between, but one must not give up and must keep on
        going. We should emulate great personalities like Edison, who worked day
        and night for his inventions. The president, prime minister, our
        teachers, parents, etc., have all worked hard to reach their
        positions.Hard work will definitely pay off. History has shown that hard
        work is an essential part of our lives. Without hard work, there is no
        success in life. An idle person, who is seen relaxing all the time, can
        never achieve success. It is impossible to reach the height of success
        without hard work. People always think of shortcuts, but there is no
        shortcut in life. Everything depends on hard work and the way you take
        up things. We have heard the success stories of Edison, Mahatma Gandhi,
        Isaac Newton, Saina Nehwal, Roger Federer and so on. These people are
        among the many who have led exemplary lives and have become perfect
        models of how hard work can bring success. They have also taught the
        world that challenges and failures are nothing but stepping stones to
        attaining success and that continuous hard work will definitely pay off
        at the right time.It has been proven in history that someone who has
        truly worked hard will definitely reach the height of success. They
        might cross the hurdles and face failures but will reach the height. A
        person who sits back and relaxes throughout the day, thinking of being
        rich one day, will never be successful. To achieve your dreams, you need
        to work hard and be determined and focused on your path. A man is like
        steel; if you use it, then it shines; and if you let it rest, then it
        rusts. If you have truly worked hard, then it will definitely pay off,
        and you will definitely enjoy your success. And if you live with your
        dreams, then you will end up dreaming only. To achieve your goal, you
        need to be determined and loyal to your work. If you are studying, then
        you need to be dedicated towards your studies and work hard for higher
        scores. If you are into a job, then you must be dedicated towards your
        work. History has proved that hard work definitely pays off.Â  So,
        understanding that hard work is the ultimate key to success would be
        your first step in achieving your goal.Hard work will undoubtedly pay
        off. Hard work is a necessary component of our lives, as history has
        shown. There is no such thing as success in life without hard work. An
        unproductive individual who is always seen relaxing will never succeed.
        It is impossible to achieve success without putting in a lot of effort.
        People are always looking for shortcuts, but there are none in life.
        Everything hinges on your ability to work hard and how you approach
        problems. To reach your goals, you must work hard, be determined, and
        stay focused on your goals. A man is like steel; if it is utilised, it
        shines; if it is not used, it rusts. If you have truly worked hard, it
        will certainly pay off, and you will undoubtedly enjoy your success;
        however, if you live your dreams, you will end up only dreaming. You
        must be determined and dedicated to your work in order to achieve your
        goal. If you are studying, you must be committed to your academics and
        work hard to achieve higher grades; if you are working, you must be
        committed to your job. Hard labour pays off in the end, as history has
        shown. We have all heard about the efforts successful people have put in
        to make a life. A perfect example of this would be A.P.J. Abdul Kalam,
        the Former President of India. He was known to sell newspapers as a
        child. Look at what he is today. He is called the Missile Man of India.
        Many like him have become living examples of how even the worst
        situations can lead you to the best of situations.

      <h3>Explanations Of Smart Working</h3>
      <p>
        Smart working is a fairly new concept introduced to provoke
        organizations toÂ adapt to the future of workÂ and new ways of working.Â 
        According to this framework, people are at the center of everything, and
        it focuses onÂ enabling employees to be more empoweredÂ to choose their
        own ways of working in order to achieve maximum productivity.Â  Smart
        working is about more than just completing tasks. It is aboutÂ choosing
        the best and most productive ways and technologiesÂ to achieve business
        goals. For this, cross-departmental collaboration is necessary, and
        working in silos is just not an option.Â Â  Even though some organizations
        argue that flexible work arrangements may hurt their productivity and
        financial stability, research has proved the opposite. Additionally,
        smart working relies on the right workplace technology that is
        user-friendly, well-integrated, and powered by AI. AÂ digital workplace
        environmentÂ needs to enable employees toÂ work smarter, not harder.
        Unfortunately, the amount of different tech solutions companies use
        today can beÂ one of the biggest productivity blockers. Start working
        smarter today with Haiilo communications platform! Book a demo The
        Characteristics of Smart Working vs. Traditional Working Smart working
        has certain traits and characteristics that are significantly different
        from traditional ways of working. Letâ€™s take a look at theÂ 6 biggest
        differences.Â  1. Agility and flexibility Unlike traditional ways of
        working, smart workingÂ focuses on agile methodologiesÂ that enable people
        to better adapt to change and unexpected workplace situations. It
        requires organizations to move away from strict processes and procedures
        and become more agile.Â Proper change managementÂ encourages people to
        focus on the outcome, not the blockers. ðŸ“¹ Check out our Masterclass
        about top 5 change management models. Smart working challenges companies
        to offer more flexible work arrangements.Â Â Traditional ways of workÂ are
        based on the concept of owning peopleâ€™s time.Â  Today, some organizations
        are more sceptical about working from home, butÂ flexible working
        arrangementsÂ have many benefits and we will discuss them later in this
        blog.Â  2. Cross-departmental collaboration According to PwC survey,Â 55%
        of organizations work in silosÂ and are fighting the negative sides of it
        every day. Smart working requires all departments within an organization
        to work towards a common goal. In other words,Â organizational silos need
        to be broken downÂ at all costs so that teams in different departments
        can easily collaborate on various projects.Â  Projects withÂ strong
        cross-functional collaborationÂ in addition to executive support have
        aÂ 76% success rate, according to Stanford-based transformational
        leadership expert Behnam Tabrizi. But success drops toÂ 19% when
        projectsÂ have only moderate cross-functional support. 3. Bottom-up
        feedback Within companies that still practice the traditional way of
        working, top-down feedback is a must, while bottom-up or
        employee-to-manager feedback needs to be practiced.Â  Smart way of
        working encourages and drivesÂ bottom-up feedbackÂ where employees are
        invited toÂ regularly give feedback about and to their superiors.Â  Most
        companies that truly care about their employeesâ€™ experience at work know
        how important employee-manager relationships are. So most of them
        haveÂ implemented pulse surveysÂ to help their managers understand how to
        better lead their teams.Â  4. Organizational alignment and workplace
        transparency When employees are aligned with the companyâ€™s north star,
        the chances to get to that start are much higher. Moreover, if
        employeesÂ understand and live by yourÂ organizationâ€™s core values, they
        should know exactly whatâ€™s expected from them. Workers in companies that
        practice smart working will always evaluate activities, projects, and
        initiatives based on their understanding of the companyâ€™s ultimate
        goals.Â  However, organizational alignment canâ€™t be achieved
        withoutÂ complete workplace transparency. Yet,Â 50% of employeesÂ say that
        a lack of transparency holds their company back. So employers need
        toÂ openly talk about the good and the badÂ because this is the best way
        to gain trust and commitment from employees.
